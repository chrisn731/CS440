## Assignment 1 - Problem Solving and Path Planning
### Grade: (118/100)
The first assignment was all about general problem using different methods such as:
<ul>
	<li> A* and Theta* Graph Search</li>
	<li> Adversarial Search</li>
	<li> Local Search </li>
	<li> Constrain Satisfaction Problem (CSP) </li>
	<li> Logic-based Reasoning </li>
</ul>
The project includes an interactive graph meant to visualize the A* and Theta* algorithms from the given
assignment. Here is a glimpse at the graph visualization on a random graph with a blocked node percentage of 10%:

## Assignment 2 - Probabilistic Reasoning
### Grade: (98/105)
The second assignmnet involved using probability to determine and reason about certain scenarios.
Topics included were:
<ul>
	<li> Bayesian Networks </li>
		<ul>
			<li> Inference by Enumeration </li>
			<li> Inference by Variable Elimination </li>
		</ul>
	<li> Direct Sampling </li>
		<ul>
			<li> Rejection Sampling </li>
			<li> Weighted Sampling </li>
		</ul>
	<li> Temporal Models </li>
		<ul>
			<li> Filtering </li>
			<li> Smoothing </li>
			<li> Most Likely Explanation (MLE) </li>
			<li> Prediction </li>
		</ul>
	<li> Utility Theory</li>
		<ul>
			<li> Calculating Expected Utility</li>
			<li> Value of Perfect Information </li>
		</ul>
	<li> Markov Decision Process - Value Iteration</li>
</ul>
This assignmnet also incldued a section of applying filtering onto a graph with a rover on it.
The project required the rover to be on a graph of 100x100 and use filtering to create a heatmap
of cells with the highest probability the rover was on. The visualization looked like:
